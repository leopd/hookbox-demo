This is a demonstration of hookbox to accompany my guest lecture on
real-time web development with python:

http://www.embracingchaos.com/2011/02/real-time-web-with-hookbox.html

The code included demonstrates a trivial web chat application.
It is written using hookbox for a COMET server, 
JQuery for web UI,
and CherryPy for the supportnig web application.

To use the web chat, make sure you have cherrypy and hookbox:
    sudo easy_install cherrypy
    sudo easy_install hookbox

Then start the rubber_stamp app:
    python ows/rubber_stamp.py &

Now start hookbox;
    hookbox --cbport=8080 -a adminpassword &

You can Watch hookbox from
    http://localhost:8001/admin/

Now open the chat.html file in two browsers and watch them talk:
    open webchat/chat.html
    open webchat/chat.html
